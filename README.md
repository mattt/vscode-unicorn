# ðŸ¦„ Unicorn

A [Visual Studio Code][code] extension that adds a status bar entry
showing Unicode data for selected characters.

## Demo

Watch the status bar entry in the bottom right of the window
update with the Unicode name and code point of the current character
as the cursor moves through the document.

Clicking on the status bar entry opens a panel with additional information.
